            Chilli Padi started off as a restaurant which was founded in 1997 and has been synonymous with authentic
            Peranakan Cuisine, rich heritage and gourmet excellence. We have since built an island-wide footprint with our
            catering arm, flagship restaurant and chain of cafeterias, collectively known as{' '}

            In 2011, we initially offered our confinement meals at our restaurant. Encouraged by the positive response and
            demand, we expanded to serve mummies islandwide during their postpartum recovery.
